## ðŸš€ Technologies
Technologies that I used.

Typescript

## ðŸ”– How to Run?

#### Make a clone

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Koemyy/image-rename.git
cd image rename
And thats it!
```

## ðŸ¤“ Create the folders

First, create two folders in the source directory: one named oldImages for the images that will be renamed, and another named "newImages" for the renamed images. </br>
Of course, you can create them with different names and make changes in lines 4 and 5 of the renameImages.ts file.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the renameImage.ts.
